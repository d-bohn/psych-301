Research methods and statistics can seem like a daunting--if not completely scary--topic!
This is particularly true if it is your first introduction to research. If not scary,
many people tend to compare research with a snooze-fest (see above). While not everyone will
share my excitement about research methods and statistics, I do think that a fundamental 
understanding of the basics can be applicable across whatever field of study and future
career aspirations you may have.

Whatever your notions of research methods and statistics may be, my goal is to get you
excited about them! While you may not reach the level of excitment I have for reasearch
methods and statistics, I hope at the very least to convince you that learning some of
the fundementals are important for you moving forward.

Aside from the fact that this course is required for graduation, why should you care about
research methods? I think it is paramount to understand the importance of this class before we delve into
the assignments and statistics. Below I highlight several potential paths that I've observed
across a number of undergraduate students I have mentored over the years. I try to tackle some
misconceptions about why research and statistics knowledge is unimportant for certain career paths,
and why everyone psychology student should care about research as much as me!

## Academic Path
Regardless of what your potential future career aspirations are, if you decide to extend your training in
psychology past an undergraduate degree you will encounter research and statistics again. Of course, the degree and
depth of this exposure will depend on your program. For example, I spend most of my day teaching and doing
research and analyses (my subfield of psychology is Social Psychology). However, my clinical psychology
peers do those things in addition to seeing clients. I'll talk about going into a "clinical" or "counseling"
career path momentarily, but first let me talk about the importance of research for graduate school in
general.

@descutner1989 surveyed faculty members at top psychology PhD programs on what they viewed as most 
important for incoming graduate students. They found that "Doing research" ranked number 5 on the list of
most important qualities for incoming graduate students. This key area of expertise ranked ahead of qualities
such as "Getting good grades", "Creativity", and "High intelligence".

Further, a more recent survey of graduate students found that students rated participation in research as one of the
most important factors that influenced their "preparedness for graduate school" [@huss2002factors].

## Clinical Sub-Path
Many psychology students are interested in being a counselor or going for a clinical PhD, focusing more on
applied therapy and services rather than research. Oftentimes these students erroneously think that because
they want to pursue the clinical sub-field of psychology that they will not need statistics or research methods.
FALSE! As I mentioned in my Welcome, I started my graduate career as a Clinical Psychology student. Aside from
the fact that one of the required courses for that major was "Research Design and Statistics", a large part of
my clinical training was reading and evaluating scientific research articles on cutting-edge research and
therapies. Having a foundational understanding of research methods and statistics allowed me to critically
evaluated whether or not research on specific types of therapy or interventions was reliable and valid (
which we will talk about later in the course). Additionally, knowing about research methods and statistics
was essential for successfully communicating with my colleagues and clients the information I learned.

Oh, and the survey I mentioned above? It was a survey of faculty at Clinical PhD programs. Even within clinical
programs research experience is weighed heavily as an important skill for incoming graduate students! In short,
do not underestimate the importance of research and statistics knowledge for your future academic careers!

## Industry Path
Research and statistics is important for industry, too, just like academia or clinical services.
Hart Research Associates conducted a
[survey](https://www.aacu.org/publications-research/periodicals/it-takes-more-major-employer-priorities-college-learning-and) 
of over 300 employers to ask them what was important for new hires. Guess what? One of the key findings from
the survey was that employers value cross-cutting knowledge, including research [@hart_2013]!

> Employers endorse several educational practices as potentially helpful in preparing college students for workplace success.
> These include practices that require students to conduct research and use evidence-based analysis; gain in-depth knowledge
> in the major and analytic, problem-solving, and communication skills; and apply their learning in real-world settings.

There are several questions the researchers asked that had respondents highlighting the usefulness of research experience
in helping undergraduate students prepare for the workplace. This is further corroborated by findings that suggest that
experiences related to research and research methods are a highly desirable skills across multiple occupational
fields [@burrus2013].

A quick personal anecdote on the importance of research knowledge across fields: Two of my most recent undergraduate
research assistants (RAs) graduated and took jobs in industry. They had both worked with me for three years doing typical
RA duties such as running participants, data entry, stimulus gathering and manipulation. They also took the opportunity
to participate in local research conferences presenting their own data to peers and faculty.

Having mentored them and worked with them, I was a job reference for both of these students. When I got calls from potential
employers the thing they were most impressed with was the amount of research they did the and knowledge they had about social
science research methods. This allowed me to talk about each students' success at being able to critically think about issues
with a scientific mindset, independently perform research tasks successfully, and their ability to generate valuable insight
and questions--all of which were skills that they learned by taking a class such as this, and applying the knowledge with 
hands-on experience in our lab!

# Conclusions
In short, I believe that understanding basic research methods and statistics can be beneficial to anyone--whether
you plan on staying in academia or continuing on for an advanced degree, or if you plan to do something in private
business (HR, data analysis) or industry. Graduate admissions people and businesses alike value that types of
critical thinking and applied knowledge that are inherent in fully understanding psychological and/or behavioral
research methods.

Aside from taking this course, you can further your research experience by joining a lab (check out the World Campus
online research lab!), or volunteering at a local university helping a faculty member with their research!
