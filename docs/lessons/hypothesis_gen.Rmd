# Hypothesis Generation
Generating scientific ideas and turning them into a hypothesis or multiple hypotheses can
be tricky, especially if the process is new. A scientific hypothesis needs to be both
specific and succinct enough to let the reader know what the research question being
tested is, how it will be tested, and what the expected results are. 

I will briefly walk through the list of questions I ask myself when I am trying to write a
hypothesis for a scientific manuscript. For this exercise, I will explore emoji use.
Note that I have not thoroughly researched this topic, this is just for illustrative
purposes.

# Steps for generating a good hypothesis
Before we walk through each step, remember:

  - Your research question has to be *testable*
  
  - Your research question needs to include two IVs and 1 DV
  
    - Each IV needs at least two levels, and one of the IVs needs to be able to be
    manipulated (i.e., able to have random assignment of participants)

## 1. What am I interested in?
A good hypothesis starts with a good question. Ask yourself what you are interested in about
the topic, what aspects of this topic are seem understudied or have some questions that
should have been researched but have not been investigated yet.

For this example, one thing that I am interested in is how individuals that use emojis in texts
are viewed by others. I could just as easily be interested in exploring whether individuals who
read text requests that contain emojis are more likely to comply with the request then if it is
just straight text. Let's focus on the first one. This is a relatively simple question that can
be unpacked into a full fledged hypothesis.

Note that both of the example areas of interest are testable (or, rather, falsifiable).

### 1-2. Narrow the scope of your question
OK, I am interested in the perception of individuals who use emojis. Let's narrow the scope
and ask a more specific question: are individuals who use emojis in their texts seen any
differently than those who do not use emojis? By narrowing the focus to compare just emoji
users to non-emoji users makes this a more feasible question.

### 1-3. Has this been tested before?
Once you settle on a question that is testable, you need to do the necessary background research
on whether or not this question has been asked before. Refer to

1. [IV, DV, What-the-V!?](lessons/iv_dv_what.html) \
2. [What is a good research topic?](lessons/finding_research_topic.html)

for how to conduct a proper background literature review. Remember, researching and background
literature reviews do not stop until the manuscript is complete!

### 1-4. What am I expecting the results to be?
You should not move on to the other steps until you have a firm understanding of what you would expect
the results to be. So, as of now my research question is

> Are individuals who use emojis in their texts seen any differently than those who do not use emojis?

What do I expect to happen? Well, intuitively, perhaps those who use emojis are seen as friendlier than
those who do not because emojis imply a connection between the sender and the reader that simple text
does not.

Or, perhaps those who use emojis are viewed as younger than those who do not (that is, emojis are a relatively
new invention). And I know from the literature on person perception that younger (babyface looking) people are seen
as more trustworthy and happy than those who appear older and more mature looking.

OK, from my two intuitive insights, it appears as those a more focused research question is naturally forming.
Combining my insights, I can say that those who use emojis in texts will be viewed overall more positive than
those who do not use emojis. Positive in this case includes being viewed as younger, friendlier, more 
trustworthy, and less mature than those who do not use emojis.

## 2. How will I test this?
OK, to summaries at this point, my research question is coming together. Overall, I predict a positivity bias
for those who use emojis in their texts compared to those who do not. Now, I need to think about how I can
test this hypothesis. One idea is to show participants fake iPhone messages either with or without emojis
present and have them rate the sender on a number of qualities. For example, I could show some participants
an image of a fake text message chain with emojis, and others the same conversation without emojis.

Perhaps something such as this for the emoji condition:

> Hi! I'm excited to take part in this experiment with you ðŸ˜† I just hope the researchers don't make us
do anything too crazy ðŸ’ŠðŸ’‰ðŸ§¬ðŸ¦ ðŸ§ª

Versus something like this for the non-emoji condition:

> Hi! I'm excited to take part in this experiment with you. I just hope the researchers don't make us
do anything too crazy

Then, after participants see one of the two text messages, they rate the sender on how "friendly",
"trustworthy", "young/old", and "dominant" they appear on a 7 point Likert-type scale.

## 3. What are my variables?
Next, I need to make sure I know what my variables are, and if they meet the requirements of the
Research Proposal.

1. IV: Emojis in the texts or plain text

  - This is the IV that is able to be manipulated, and has two levels (emojis present vs. not present)
  
2. IV: Nothing yet! Dang...

3. DV: Perceptions of text senders

For the second IV, perhaps I could explore whether or not there is an interaction with participant gender.
That is, do I think that both males and females will respond similarly to emoji and non-emoji users? Or,
what about the gender of the sender? Or age of the observer, or age of the sender? Let's focus on sender
gender.

2. IV: Sender gender

  - Not able to be manipulated, but it does have at least two levels (apparent males vs. apparent females)

## 4. How do I put this in scientific hypothesis form?
Finally, I come to the point where I can attempt to put this in a scientific manuscript form. I'll write
a hypothesis paragraph that I could typically include in the "Overview" section of a manuscript's
Introduction section.

> The current experiment sought to examine whether or not perceptions of emoji users are quantitatively
different than non-emoji users. Specifically, I hypothesized that observers who view messages that
contain emojis will view those senders as friendlier, more trustworthy, younger, and less dominant than
messages from senders without emojis. Additionally, I predict that sender gender will interact
with positive perceptions of the sender, such that female senders will benefit from emoji use (i.e., be viewed
as more positive) than male senders.

# Conclusions
Yes, hypothesis generation can be a bit difficult if you have never done it before, especially trying to get
the scientific lingo down. These things come with practice, and hopefully following the four steps that
I outlined above can help you become more familiar with the process!
